## Insight App 
### Part of my project at Insight Data Science was to deploy an app that showcased my preterm labor risk prediction tool.
I chose to deploy my app using Streamlit and to host it on Heroku.
My app can be found at: https://preterm-predictor.herokuapp.com.
In the current repository I have placed all the files necessary to deploy the app, as well as a py file containing the LightGBM model from which the pickle file was created.
#### For all the information on the general project and the code behind making P2, please refer to my Insight-Project repository.
